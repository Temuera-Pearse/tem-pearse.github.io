        Research Neuroplasticity * Discuss how understanding the principles of
        neuroplasticity benefits people.
      </h1>

      <h2>
        understanding the principles of neuroplasticity benefits people by
        showing them that your brain is able to be remoulded. We are able to
        unlearn behaviour patterns that don’t benefit us in our current
        environment and learn new ones that do. Understanding neuroplasicity
        gives people an edge when learning new skills compared to those that
        don’t purely because they understand that they are not ever fully stuck
        in their self imposed ways.
      </h2>

      <h1>
        * Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity
        for your benefit.
      </h1>
      <h2>
        I think I have been using neuroplasicity for a while. Last year I
        unlearned bad eating habits and learned better ones. I have unlearned
        heavy substance abuse and made the gym a habit and have learned a lot
        about my body in the process. I just didn’t have a name for it. Now that
        I do know about it. I can use it by figuring out and unlearning old
        habits and consciously trying to replace those with new skills and more
        beneficial habits.
      </h2>

      <h1>What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</h1>
      <h2>
        Practise, practise, practise. Constant repetition of activities helps
        build stronger, thicker and more hard wired connections in the brain.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Sleeping well, eating healthy, drinking water and exercising puts your
        body and mind into the best state possible to be able to learn.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Understanding neuroplasicity as much as possible by learning how the
        brain works actually puts you in better to increase it. Understanding
        the information in front of you. Its one thing to recite word for word
        what is said but if you can put the information into your own words and
        actively practise the information then you’ll be much better off
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Travelling: seeing other peoples perspectives gives you deep insight
        into how the world works. If you stay at home you will be stuck in an
        echo chamber and you may never learn anything new.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Creating: gives you the opportunity to make mistake and learn from them.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        Learning an instrument rewires your brain a lot. From hand eye
        coordination to timing awareness to even understanding music on a deeper
        level mechanical level understanding why certain songs trigger certain
        emotion. Very helpful.

      <h2>
        If you don’t grow you will wither away. Growth mindset is that your
        talents and abilities can be developed with effort, good teaching and
        persistence. It relevant because if people believe their talents and
        abilities can only take them so they will only get that far.

        They already have. I’ve come into this course with a mindset that I need
        to learn to better myself in life. My strategy is telling myself “I no
        not much about this” and my learning plan is “I need to learn to this
        because I want to be paid better.”
