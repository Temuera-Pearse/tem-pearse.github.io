        What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego
        due to the core learning?
      </h1>
      <h2>
        I guess i learned that if things get hard i can feel my brain wanting to
        pull away and do something else. i need to tall myself to stick at it. i
        also know my ego feels good when it finally figures things out. which is
        funny as its the ego that didnt want to do it in the first place. last
        thing that the ego is very self centered so when you put it away doors
        tend to open up which is also funny becuase alot of the time the ego is
        trying to do the exact same thing but can't because its trying to force
        things open.
      </h2>
      <h1>
        What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and
        programming?
      </h1>
      <h2>
        I think ultimatley just not being a robot, you can be a coder and be a
        good person at the same time. But more importantly the world is moving
        into a place with programming with AI and such that forgetting these
        things will most likely lead to a destructive path. on this path one
        canoot forget ones own humanity. not just for the sake of the self but
        everyone. programmers are now playing a key role in humanity and we need
        to be mindful of that.
      </h2>
      <h1>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h1>
      <h2>
        that it was here in the first place. i thought i was coming to learn how
        to code. But its good that i also learned how to be a mindful person as
        well
      </h2>
      <h1>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h1>
      <h2>
        probably talking to other people. Somtimes get anxious but i get over it
      </h2>
      <h1>
        Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
        focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?
      </h1>
      <h2>
        probably the same reason why docter schools have it as well. Most
        Intelligent people lack social skills and seriously need to develop
        them.
      </h2>
      <h1>
        Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
        time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming
        instead? Justify your answer.
      </h1>
      <h2>
        No not a waste time. im going to be coding the rest of my life so im not
        in a hurry. but i may never get a chance to learn about this ever again.
        so its good i learned it now.
