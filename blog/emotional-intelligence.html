    <h1 class="text-background">1. What is Emotional Intelligence?</h1>
    <h2 class="text-background">
      Intelligence in regards to ones emotions and the emotions of others.
      Displays of good emotional intelligence are when someone is mindful of
      their own thoughts and actions and the thoughts and actions of others.
      When a person can understand and convey back how someone is feeling in a
      way that is helpful that is good practise of emotional intelligence. When
      someone can take initiative that is helpful to the objective, that too is
      good practise of emotional intelligence.

    <h1 class="text-background">2. How is EQ different to IQ?</h1>
    <h2 class="text-background">
      IQ is ability to use logic and the ability to grasp and convey complex
      ideas. EQ is the ability to recognise ones own emotions and others
      emotions and using that knowledge to guide decisions.
    </h2>
    <h1 class="text-background">3. Why is EQ important?</h1>
    <h2 class="text-background">
      Because no one wants to be around a robot or someone who doesn’t have good
      EQ. Our feelings are important and it’s hugely important to be aware of
      the emotions of those around you. Having good EQ qualities will be
      beneficial to not only you but everyone around you.
