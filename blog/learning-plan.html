      A description of your strengths and limitations when it comes to learning
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text-background">
      Im not really sure i have many strengths when it comes to learning. I
      haven't had the best time when its come to learning anything. its takes me
      a while to understand things people are trying to teach me. the only i've
      found to be affective is to try things out in the field and see how things
      work. trail and error. Retaining information like names (of people,
      concepts, of anything) has always been hard for which makes explaining an
      issue as i get the formula right just without the correct terminology alot
      of the time. But i find once i've grasped something im able to experiment
      with in alot of ways.

      developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text-background">
      team working skills: id like to learn how to be value asset in a team.
      support skills: id like to know how to always be helpful in the web dev
      workplace and show people i can be supportive in . breakdown skill: not
      sure thats the word for it but be able to take someones needs and break
      them down into workable chunks. delegating skills: be able to fairly
      delegate those chunks to people. (i want to be able to split a workload
      fairly and thats by being able to identify the workload as whole and
      knowing what chunk is more work and which is less)

     i will put in more hours, the stress i may feel in the coming months pales in comparison to
      the mundane stress i felt working in a place i didnt want to be. i use
      that memory now as reminder to myself that this is something i really want
      to do. so if i do find myhself getting behind i will ask for help and then
      i will listen intently. but if i am late i will negotiate extensions in a
      timely and professional manner. i hope if doesnt come to that. but if it
      does i will put initial blame on my poor time management of that week.
