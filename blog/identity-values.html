      1. Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision.Discuss
      how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you
      made, and how you reflect on the decision now.

      I made and unethical decision to nuke 4 bases in fallout 76 once.
      But it was ethical because it
      meant all of my friends could harvest rare materials from the radiation
      zone of that nuked place. everyone on the server knows who sets the nuke
      because the game notifies everyone when it happens. I have to live with
      that guilt everyday but I weighed up my options and put my friends first
      which Im glad about. Ethics work differently in a post apocalyptic world.

       I come from 2 families a full on Maori family
      and a full on Pakeha family. Both families are vastly different and have
      different views on the world on basically every level. Growing up I have
      been able to see both sides of the political spectrum and the effects they
      have on each other. Though its made me come across as different to both
      people. i like how I have ended up though.

       I had band I was in. I was lead singing. Had the
      words down. But the bass player couldn’t play his part so needed more
      practises. He went off at me when I didn’t show up once but I had my part
      down so didn’t see why I needed to be there. I’m pretty good at music so I
      knew all he needed to do was learn his part well and add it into the
      practise but he felt I was being lazy. But he was the one who couldn’t
      play his part right. Hell even I could’ve done it better but I let it
      slide anyway. The show was awesome everyone loved it
