    <div class="text-background">
      <h1>1. were blocked on a simple problem:</h1>
      <h2>
        a simple problems i always come up against is where i left my keys, vape
        or phone in my room. When i lose these items i feel i bit of panic. but
        normally i retrace my steps and actions until i find a spot in my mind
        where i can defineatly say had stopped using those things. from there i
        look around the spot i last remembered using them and i find it.

      <h1>2. elegantly solved a problem.</h1>
      <h2>
        at my old work i used to find shortcuts all the time. There were alot
        processes that had alot of time spent walking back and forth. purely
        becuase parts of the job had computer admin 2 or 3 times in one process.
        so in order to eliminate walk time from the computer to the warehouse.
        i'd just do all the admin at the end. may have not been the official way
        to do things but i saved alot of time which was more important to my
        employer.

        on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving
        techniques/processes:

        <strong>psuedocode:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        not hugely confident yet. i felt i was looking at the instructions more
        and working everything out in my head. i feel i am given a task that is
        vague i'd use it then.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <strong>Trying something:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>i do this alot. make mistakes and correct them form there. good</h2>
      <h2>
        <strong>rubber duck:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        i do this alot minus the rubber duck. i get coding problems alot and
        walk myself through all of it.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <strong>reading error message:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        i do this at the same as rubber duck. its the first thing i refer to to
        see if code works
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <strong>console.logging:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        i dont do this as much as i should. in terms of problem solving i look
        to other methods. normally i use is to see if it works. but never to
        trouble-shoot.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <strong>googling:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        i've been using this for as long as i can remember. its a good skill to
        have in any job
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <strong>asking peers for help:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        not really. ill probably do it more face to face. i used to use it alot
        at work. we would work the problem out together by both thinking aloud.
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <strong>asking coaches for help:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        i've done it a few times. but for admin things normally. i exhaust all
        other options before turning to coaches. i do take on the feedback
        though. its very helpful
      </h2>
      <h2>
        <strong>improving process with reflection:</strong>
      </h2>
      <h2>
        yea its a time to look back and be critical of yourself. when you
        activley engage with yourself. you end up taking on more information and
        make better decision.
