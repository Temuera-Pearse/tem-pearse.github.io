      An analogy to describe JavaScript and its relationship to HTML and CSS.
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text-background">
      Javascript is the third piece of the puzzle that is web pages. HTML is the content of your page where as CSS is the prettiness and style of the page. JavaScript is workhorse of the webpage. It’s the calculator that brings your webpage to life. It does all the complex calculations and responding to users actions, when you have a question like “what is my horoscope?” JavaScript is there taking your birthday and birthplace and outputting the results telling you “you will have no friends”. Without it the internet would be pages and pages of pretty looking words and pictures and that would be it. Pretty boring I think.

      Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text-background">
      Control flows is the order in which instructions in a program are executed. Loops are a type of control flow that allow a program to repeat a set of instructions until a certain condition is met. An example of a control flow is like making a bowl of cereal

      1. Open the cereal box and remove the bag of cereal
      2. Pour the desired amount of cereal into a bowl
      3. Check the milk level in the container
      4. If there is enough milk, pour milk over the cereal until it is covered
      5. If there is not enough milk, refill the milk container
      6. Add sugar (if desired)
      7. Use a spoon to mix the cereal, milk, and sugar together
      8. Enjoy the cereal

      Loops are not nessecary in this process but we can use a loop to make multiple bowls if we want. all we would need to do is repeat steps 2-7 until we had the desired amount of bowls.

      Overall Control flows are the order of a process and loops are the repeats we can put into the process to get meet conditions we would like to achieve.

      Describe what the DOM is and an example of how you might interact with it.
    </h1>
    <h2>
      The DOM stand for Document Object Model and it provides the means to interact with objects in an HTML document. The DOM creates a tree-like structure of all the elements in a webpage. Each element is called a node and each node has properties that can be accessed by developers to make changes through Javascript</h2>

      <h2>
      You can use the DOM to change the colour of a button when someone clicks on it or to add a new picture or change text based on the users input. its a powerful tool to make websites come alive.

      Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects
    </h1>
    <h2>
      Data arrays and objects are both ways to store data however there are some key differences between both.

      Arrays are data stored one after the other in memory each with their own unique number starting from [0] all the way to infinity [n]. To access them you need to reference the index of the item you want to access then add the number they are. For example if the array is named “thisArray” then the first item you could access would be accessed like this : “thisArray[0].” so if you wanted to log it to the console the whole process would you would go like this
    </h2>

    </div>
    <h2>
      Objects though store data as key-value pairs. if you have an object lets say “Lebron James,” you could put all his stats into the object where the key could be things like Height, weight, dunks or 3 pointers. the whole object would look like this... 

      So yeah both are ways to store data you may want to call on later.

      Explain what functions are and why they are helpful.
    </h1>
    <h2 class="text-background">
      Functions are blocks of reusable chunks code that performs a specific task.
     You can make all sorts of functions that perform specific actions and they can be called from multiple places within a program which is super handy as you won’t need to rewrite the same code over and over because coding is hard and coders are lazy (they are not lazy actually). As you write more and more code you need to maintain a sense of tidiness as well. One key aim to coding successfully is to be able to have someone else understand what is going on. Functions help with this by reducing clutter. 

     Let’s say you want to add 1+2. You could write a function that could do just that so anytime you want to add 2 numbers that function can be called to do that action. Now think of a calculator, you obviously want to be able to do much much more than just add numbers. Every single button has its own function and that function is called upon to perform that operation and return back the result. very nifty. here is an add function that adds 2 numbers together.
