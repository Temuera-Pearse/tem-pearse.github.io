        I’m from Wellington but am living in Auckland now. I always think about
        listening to others, even when I don’t agree with them. I think there is
        a lot of learning to be had when you try to understand someone else’s
        perspective. alot of peoples values come from identities given to them
        by there parents and societies they were brought up in and it can be
        quite interesting learning about them. but sometimes it can really
        boring learning about someone as well, like when your at a bar or a club
        and some real drunk person is yelling you their life story. i try good
        exit strategies like pretending someone else is trying to talk to me. I
        joined dev academy because I want to learn how to code. I like the
        environment coding brings. learning how to to code kind of feels like
        learning how to play a game professionally, the vibe of coding and
        gaming kind of feels the same to me. Which I think is cool.
