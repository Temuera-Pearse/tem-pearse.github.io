      <h2>What is the difference between Margin, Border, and Padding?</h2>
      <p>
        Margins borders and paddings are used in web design. We use them to put
        all of our content into and set peremeters around them to control how
        they look on a web page and where they sit. When we use them properly we
        can make all sorts of beautiful web pages.
      </p>

      <div class="image-margin">
        <img
          src="https://blog.hubspot.com/hs-fs/hubfs/Google%20Drive%20Integration/Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding-2.png?width=650&name=Update%20css%20margin%20vs%20padding-2.png"
          alt="picture of margin map"
          width="500"
          height="500"
        />
      </div>

      <p>
        Margins are the space outside of an elements border. they are the space
        between elements. kind of like the space between planets, space itself
        would be the margin.
      </p>

      <p>
        Borders are boundary around the padding of an elements content. they
        seperate one element from anonther element. they can be used to seperate
        elements from eachother visually. also like space you could say borders
        are like the edge of a planets atmosphere.
      </p>

      <p>
        Padding is the space between an elements content and border. and also
        like space the padding would be the atmosphere of a planet whereas the
        content would be the planet itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sum it all up the difference between a margin, border and padding is
        their positioning relative to the content they surround. but they all
        work together to bring you a nice protective box.
